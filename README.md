# BASHWeather

Usage:
    Obtain a API key from weather underground and set the API_Key variable equal to it.
    Zip code is needed to find location, the program will ask for it, unless you pass it as a sys arg. i.e. #python3 WeatherDashboard.py 12345
    
 I included quite a few more variables than are displayed as output to make customization easier.
